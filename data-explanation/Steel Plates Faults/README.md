fault classification

#### Data Set Information

| Data Set Characteristics | Attribute Characteristics | Associated Tasks |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Multivariate             | Real                      | Classification   |

| Number of Instances | Number of Attributes |      |      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| 1941                | 27                   |      |      |

(Faults.NNA data)

There are 34 fields. The first 27 fields describe some kind of steel plate faults seen in images

The last 7 columns are one hot encoded classes, i.e. if the plate fault is classified as "Stains" there will be a 1 in that column and 0's in the other columns. If you are unfamiliar with one hot encoding, **just know that the last seven columns are your class labels.**

Every dataset record represents a superficial fault of a stainless steel leaf. There are 6 different typologies of
faults. The fault description is constituted by 27 indicators representing the geometric shape of the fault
and its contour. We have 1941 records in total. 

The Faultsâ€™ dataset underlines, in a well-marked way, the efficacy in using meta-classifiers and is further
illustrative of the evidence that serves to establish the quality of Meta-Consensus as a classifier. While it
occupies the third position in terms of weighted average, it is the first of the set that does not create a
base classifier (Arcing, Boosting) but rather, uses the available base classifiers.
