# Eco(Electricity Consumption & Occupancy) 

The ECO data set is a comprehensive data set for non-intrusive load monitoring and occupancy detection research. It was collected in 6 Swiss households over a period of 8 months. For each of the households, the ECO data set provides:

# UK ERC dataset

This dataset records the power demand from five houses. In each house we record both the whole-house mains power demand every six seconds as well as power demand from individual appliances every six seconds. In three of the five houses (houses 1, 2 and 5) we also record the whole-house voltage and current at 16 kHz.
