### Etc  


* [Hill-Valley](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/lsh9382/data-explanation/Hill-Valley): This is NOT a manufacturing dataset, but looks good for testing pattern detection methods.  
* [Machine Failures](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/lsh9382/data-explanation/Machine%20Failures)  
* [APS System Failures](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/lsh9382/data-explanation/APS%20System%20Failures):  The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS.
