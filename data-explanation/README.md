* [SECOM](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/SECOM>): Semiconductor manufacturing process data.  

### Chemical  

* [Gas Sensor Array Drift](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/Gas%20Sensor%20Array%20Drift>): This archive contains 13910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors exposed to 6 different gases at various concentration levels.
* [Chemical Detection Platform](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/Chemical%20Detection%20Platform>): The dataset contains 18000 time-series recordings from a chemical detection platform at six different locations in a wind tunnel facility in response to ten high-priority chemical gaseous substances.
* [Dynamic Gas Mixtures](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/Dynamic%20Gas%20Mixtures>): The data set contains the recordings of 16 chemical sensors exposed to two dynamic gas mixtures at varying concentrations. For each mixture, signals were acquired continuously during 12 hours.  

### Mechanical  

* [C-MAPSS](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/C-MAPSS>): Engine degradation simulation.  
* [PHM08: Challenge on this datset](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/PHM08%20Challenge%20on%20this%20dataset>)  
* [CNC Mill Tool Wear](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/CNC%20Mill%20Tool%20Wear>): Machining data was collected from a CNC machine for variations of tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure.  
* [Naval Propulsion Plants](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/minkyu/data-explanation/Naval%20Propulsion%20Plants/README.md): Data have been generated from a sophisticated simulator of a Gas Turbines (GT), mounted on a Frigate characterized by a COmbined Diesel eLectric And Gas (CODLAG) propulsion plant type.  

### Steel  

* [Steel Plates Faults](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/blob/minkyu/data-explanation/Steel%20Plates%20Faults/README.md).  

### Power  

* [Appliance Energy](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/minkyu/data-explanation/Appliance%20Energy/README.md): Experimental data used to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy building.  
* [Combined Cycle Power Plant](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/minkyu/data-explanation/Combined%20Cycle%20Power%20Plant/README.md): Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years.  

### Etc  


* [Hill-Valley](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/minkyu/data-explanation/Hill-Valley/README.md): This is NOT a manufacturing dataset, but looks good for testing pattern detection methods.  
* [Machine Failures](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/minkyu/data-explanation/Machine%20failure/README.md)  
* [APS System Failures](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/minkyu/data-explanation/APS%20System%20Failures/README.md):  The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS.   
* [IDA2016 Challenge: Challenge on this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/IDA2016Challenge)
