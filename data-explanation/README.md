## List of Datasets  

### Semicon  

* [PHM Data Challenge 18](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/PHM%20Data%20Challenge%2018>): Etching tool fault detection(PdM).
* [SECOM](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/SECOM>): Semiconductor manufacturing process data.  

### Chemical  

* [Gas Sensor Array Drift](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/Gas%20Sensor%20Array%20Drift>): This archive contains 13910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors exposed to 6 different gases at various concentration levels.
* [Chemical Detection Platform](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/Chemical%20Detection%20Platform>): The dataset contains 18000 time-series recordings from a chemical detection platform at six different locations in a wind tunnel facility in response to ten high-priority chemical gaseous substances.
* [Dynamic Gas Mixtures](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/Dynamic%20Gas%20Mixtures>): The data set contains the recordings of 16 chemical sensors exposed to two dynamic gas mixtures at varying concentrations. For each mixture, signals were acquired continuously during 12 hours.  

### Mechanical  

* [C-MAPSS](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/C-MAPSS>): Engine degradation simulation.  
* [PHM08: Challenge on this datset](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/PHM08%20Challenge%20on%20this%20dataset>)  
* [CNC Mill Tool Wear](<https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets/tree/sehee/data-explanation/CNC%20Mill%20Tool%20Wear>): Machining data was collected from a CNC machine for variations of tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure.  
* [Naval Propulsion Plants](): Data have been generated from a sophisticated simulator of a Gas Turbines (GT), mounted on a Frigate characterized by a COmbined Diesel eLectric And Gas (CODLAG) propulsion plant type.  

### Steel  

* [Steel Plates Faults]().  

### Power  

* [Appliance Energy](): Experimental data used to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy building.  
* [Combined Cycle Power Plant](): Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years.  

### Etc  


* [Hill-Valley](): This is NOT a manufacturing dataset, but looks good for testing pattern detection methods.  
* [Machine Failures]()  
* [APS System Failures]():  The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS.   
* [IDA2016 Challenge: Challenge on this dataset]()
