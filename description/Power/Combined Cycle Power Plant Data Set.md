> A combined cycle power plant, is an electrical power plant in which a Gas Turbine(GT) and a Steam Turbine(ST) are used in combination to produce more electrical energy from the same fuel than that would be possible from a single cycle power plant.

The gas turbine compresses air and mixes it with a fuel heated to a very high temperature. The hot air-fuel mixture moves through the blades making them spin. The fast spinning gas turbine drives a generator to generate electricity.

The exhaust (waste) heat escaped through the exhaust stack of the gas turbine is utilized by a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HSRG) system to produce steam that spins a steam turbine. This steam turbine drives a generator to produce additional electricity.

CCCP(Combined Cycle Power Plant) is assumed to produce 50% more energy than a single power plant.

The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.
For comparability with our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times. For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.
We provide the data both in .ods and in .xlsx formats.

#### Variables

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables 
- Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C, (input)
- Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar, (input)
- Relative Humidity (RH) in the range 25.56% to 100.16% (input)
- Exhaust Vacuum (V) in teh range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg (input)
- Net hourly electrical energy output (EP) 420.26-495.76 MW
  The averages are taken from various sensors located around the plant that record the ambient variables every second. The variables are given without normalization. (output)
